{: .fs-9 .text-center }

The purpose of this projects is to provide resources for learning about concepts and algorithms used in robotics, without any prior robotics knowledge in a simple and intuitive way.

After reading through the articles on this website, you should have a solid understanding of the principles on which robots (like the ones in [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc)/[FTC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc)) operate, and be able to use them in practice.
