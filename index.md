## Introduction
The purpose of this projects is to provide resources for learning about concepts and algorithms used in robotics, without any prior robotics knowledge.

It is highly recommended to understand basic concepts of programming (preferably in Python) before reading through the project, since all of the implementations discussed in the project are in Python. If you don't know much about Python but would like to learn, [Dive into Python 3](http://histo.ucsf.edu/BMS270/diveintopython3-r802.pdf) is a great place to start.

## Motivation
When I joined an FRC team and started learning about robotics, I didn't find many beginner-friendly resources for people like me. They were hard to find and scattered all around the web. One had to be quite persistent to actually learn something.

That, in a nutshell, is the reason for the creation of this website - to serve as a resource for people wanting to learn the concepts of robotics with no prior knowledge.
