## Introduction
The purpose of this projects is to provide resources for learning about concepts and algorithms used in robotics, without any prior robotics knowledge.

After reading through the articles, you should have a solid understanding of the principles on which robots (like the ones in [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc)/[FTC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc)) operate.
