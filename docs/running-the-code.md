# Running the Code
{:.no_toc}

The code on this website has been tested on a VEX EDR robot programmed in Python using [RobotMesh](https://www.robotmesh.com/). If you want to try out the code yourself, doing the same would be the easiest way -- all you'd have to do is substitute the made-up classes and methods for real ones from the VEX library and run the code.

You can download the robot model in the STEP format from [this link](https://grabcad.com/library/vex-edr-robot-1), if you're interested!
