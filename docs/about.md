## Motivation
When I joined an FRC team and started learning about robotics, I didn't find many beginner-friendly resources for people like me. They were hard to find and scattered all around the web. One had to be quite persistent to actually learn something.

That, in a nutshell, is the reason for the creation of this website - to serve as a resource for people wanting to learn the concepts of robotics, without having to go thourgh all the trouble of finding quality resources.
