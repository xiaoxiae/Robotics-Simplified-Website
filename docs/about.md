## Motivation
When I joined the FRC team [Metal Moose](https://www.metalmoose.org/) and started learning about robotics, I didn't find many beginner-friendly resources for people like me. They were hard to find and scattered all around the web. One had to be quite persistent to actually learn something on their own.

That is the main reason for the creation of this website -- to serve as a resource for people that want to learn the concepts of robotics, without having to go though all the trouble of finding quality resources.

## Contributions
I accept any and all recommendations/suggestions about this website. If there is anything you think should be changed/corrected, or you have a topic that you wish there was an article about, feel free to let me know.

You can do so either by email (`contact@robotics-simplified.com`), or by creating an issue on the website's GitHub repositories (see link on the top right of the page).
