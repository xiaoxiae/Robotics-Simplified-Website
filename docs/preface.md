## Programming Language
It is recommended to understand basic concepts of programming (preferably in Python, since all of the implementations discussed in the project are in Python) before reading through the project. If you don't know much about Python but would like to learn, [Dive into Python 3](http://histo.ucsf.edu/BMS270/diveintopython3-r802.pdf) is a great place to start.

It is also expected that you know basics of [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), since we will be basing most of the programs on objects of various classes.

If you don't know programming at all but are interested in the concepts, you can still read through the chapters and learn a lot, the code is there mainly to help you understand how the concepts could be implemented.

## Libraries and Classes
Throughout the project, there will be a lot of made-up classes like `Motor`, `Joystick` and `Gyro`. They are only used as placeholders for real classes that you would (likely) have if you were implementing some of the concepts covered on this website.
