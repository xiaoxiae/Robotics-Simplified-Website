The drivetrain of a vehicle is a group of components that deliver power to the driving wheels, hold them together and allow them to move. Here is a [resource](http://www.simbotics.org/resources/mobility/drivetrain-selection) describing various types of drivetrains.

For the purpose of this guide, however, we will only be discussing some of the most frequently used drivetrains, and the methods to operate them.
