## Introduction
The drivetrain of a vehicle is a group of components that deliver power to the driving wheels.

They are those parts of a robot that hold the motors and wheels in place and allow them to move. Here is a [resource](http://www.simbotics.org/resources/mobility/drivetrain-selection) describing various types of drivetrains.

For the purpose of this guide, however, we will only be discussing some of the most frequently used drivetrains and the methods to operate on them.
